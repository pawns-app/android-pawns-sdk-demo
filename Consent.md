Pawns Internet Sharing — Optional Consent
This app includes an optional feature provided by Pawns.app [https://pawns.app]. If you choose Consent, Pawns.app may use a portion of your internet connection on this device to route internet traffic for Pawns.app and its clients.
What enabling this means
If you consent:
Your device becomes a gateway. Pawns.app may send and receive internet traffic through your device and internet connection.
Pawns.app may process your IP address, approximate location (derived from IP), and device/network technical data to operate, manage, and secure this feature.
This feature may use data, battery, CPU, and network resources, and may affect internet performance.
Do not enable this feature if you are on a restricted network, a metered plan, or if your network/provider rules do not allow this type of use.
Only enable Pawns Internet Sharing if you are of legal age in your country and are authorized to use this device and internet connection (including under your ISP/mobile plan and network rules).
Pawns.app may share your IP address and approximate location (derived from IP) with its clients so they can access and use the shared traffic, as described in the Privacy Policy [https://pawns.app/privacy-policy].
No impact on app access
This feature is not required to use this app. If you select Do not consent, internet sharing will remain disabled and you can continue using the app normally.
Withdrawing consent
You may withdraw your consent at any time. The method to withdraw or disable this feature is provided by the owner of this app (not by Pawns.app)
